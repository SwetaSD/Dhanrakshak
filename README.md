## Overview

Ensuring safe and easy online transactions is a big challenge in today's digital world. Traditional authentication techniques like passwords and OTPs are no longer adequate in light of the increase in identity theft, cyber fraud, and unauthorized access. To stop fraud while preserving a seamless user experience, businesses and users need a more dependable and strong security system.

Static credentials, which are easily compromised, are frequently used in current user authentication and transaction security solutions. Many platforms still rely on traditional verification techniques that don't have anti-spoofing or real-time identity validation. These flaws expose systems to phishing and credential stuffing attacks, which can result in monetary losses and data breaches.

To address these challenges, this project presents an integrated platform that combines a secure payment gateway with face validation and anti-spoofing techniques with an admin panel .Users can sign up, log in, and manage images using the admin panel, which guarantees a well-organized and controllable system.

Advanced face recognition and anti-spoofing features are integrated into the payment gateway to instantly confirm the identity of users. Only successful validation allows transactions to proceed, guaranteeing a reliable and secure payment process.
